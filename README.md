# Techonologies Used
This project was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

# Problems
Was unable to add additional photos for the breeds being requested. Will return to update this project when I'm able to. Would also like to includes a favorite/like button and a link to where you can see your top breeds.

# User Stories
## MVP Goals
* As someone in search for a pup but don't have a preference in what breed I get, I want the chance to search through a list of breeds in general or search by the breed name
* As a user, I want to be able to link to an organization to learn more about the breed selected, the adoption process, things to expect, etc
* As a user, I want to be able to view the website on smaller or larger screens without running into weird issues

## Stretch Goals
* As a user I want to be able to favorite a certain breed of dog and be able to view all of my favorites on a deperate page.
* As a user, I want to be able to access additional photos and information about the selected breed.
